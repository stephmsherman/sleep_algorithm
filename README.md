Sleep Algorithm

Please examine the Sherman sleep algorithm.pdf for details

We aimed to improve standard algorithms that translate processed accelerometer data from a wrist actigraph to measures of sleep.

Participants wore a wrist actigraph while undergoing PSG recording during one night of sleep in a lab.
